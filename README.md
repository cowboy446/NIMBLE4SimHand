# NIMBLE4SimHand

This project utilizes a parameterized hand model, **NIMBLE**, for generating continuous and dense simulated right-hand datasets including meshes, textures, and keypoints, to support downstream tasks such as **hand pose estimation**. The NIMBLE model is based on a non-rigid hand structure with bones and muscles, enabling realistic hand motion simulation and anatomically plausible deformation.

## Usage
```python
python demo.py
```


## ðŸ“š Based on NIMBLE
