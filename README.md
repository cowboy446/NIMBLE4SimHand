# NIMBLE4SimHand

This project utilizes a parameterized hand model, **NIMBLE**, for generating continuous and dense simulated right-hand datasets including meshes, textures, and keypoints, to support downstream tasks such as **hand pose estimation**. The NIMBLE model is based on a non-rigid hand structure with bones and muscles, enabling realistic hand motion simulation and anatomically plausible deformation.

## Usage

1. `demo4sequence.py`: Generates a sequence of hand meshes with continuously changing poses, starting from the rest pose principal components (all zeros) and randomly varying the 30-dimensional PCA-reduced pose parameters (originally 20x3=60 dimensions)

    ```python
    python demo4sequence.py
    ```

2. `demo_ik.py`: Takes 25 hand keypoints in the NIMBLE format as input and performs inverse kinematics (IK) to compute the local axis-angle transformation parameters from the rest joints to the target joints. This can be used to drive the NIMBLE hand model, enabling a pipeline of keypoints (e.g., captured from motion capture systems) â†’ IK solving â†’ NIMBLE hand model driving â†’ mesh generation for arbitrary hand gestures.

    ```python
    python demo_ik.py
    ```

The IK solver for the NIMBLE model is implemented in `utils.py`. The file `utils_for_mano.py` provides IK solvers for both MANO and NIMBLE models. These files can be directly integrated into other projects (note: the order of axis-angle vectors differs from the MANO definition).
